The goal of this work is to better understand rhythm.  
To accomplish this I aim to implement a comprehensive 
analysis tool that incorporates the strengths of 
disparate models of various aspects of rhythm. These 
include a robust onset detection scheme based on 
pychoacoustic principles, a Tempogram (tempo tracking),
quantization & estimation of Expressive Timing (if 
applicable) and a Rhythmogram (representation of 
rhythmic grouping)

This tool will accept arbitrarily polyphonic audio data, 
perform an Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) to 
indentify and "un-mix" the various sources.  Then the 
rhythmic analyses described above will be applied to each of
the "un-mixed" audio streams to extract the pertinent 
rhythmic features.

By this I hope to show the utility ISA technique for
Blind Source Separation (BSS) as a worthy preprocessor and
facilitator to rhythmic feature detection. I also hope
to demonstrate that the various above algorithms can complement
each other in providing a more complete rhythmic representation.
