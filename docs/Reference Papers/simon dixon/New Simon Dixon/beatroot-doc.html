BeatRoot is a musical beat tracking and visualisation system.
A full description of the beat tracking algorithms appears in the paper:
<em>Automatic Extraction of Tempo and Beat from Expressive Performances</em>
which is to appear in the
Journal of New Music Research, 30(1), 2001.
The graphical user interface is described in the paper:
<em>An Interactive Beat Tracking and Visualisation System</em>
presented at the International Computer Music Conference (2001).
The file you are reading now is the user documentation for BeatRoot.
The software and the papers mentioned above are available for
<a href="http://www.oefai.at/~simon/beatroot/">download</a>.
<P>
Of course, the software is supplied as is,
with no claims to any functionality or fitness for any purpose.
Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

<H2>BeatRoot Installation Instructions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>System requirements: Linux system with JDK1.3 installed. (Timidity is
also necessary if you want playback of beat tracking of MIDI files.)
I use the Debian Linux distribution (potato). With other distributions you
might need to download the source version and change a few variables to get
the program to work.
<LI><a href="http://www.oefai.at/~simon/beatroot/">Download</a>
the file <font face=courier><b>beatroot-0.2.tgz</b></font>
<LI>Unpack the tar archive using:<BR>
<font face=courier><b>tar zxf beatroot-0.2.tgz</b></font>
<LI>Change to the beatroot-0.2 directory:<BR>
<font face=courier><b>cd beatroot-0.2</b></font>
<LI>Edit the file <BR>
<font face=courier><b>.beatrootrc</b></font><BR>
and copy it to your home directory. The parameters listed in this file must
be given correct values for the system to function fully. You may add other
parameter settings if you wish.
<LI>Run the program:<BR>
<font face=courier><b>beatroot</b></font><BR>
Details of options and usage are given below.
<LI>If this fails, or you wish to modify the program, you can download the
source code <font face=courier><b>beatroot-0.2-src.tgz</b></font>, edit the
<font face=courier><b>makefile</b></font> and/or source as necessary, and
rebuild the program. The source code is provided free under the

<H2>BeatRoot Usage Instructions</H2>

<H3>Usage Summary</H3>
<FONT face=courier>
beatroot<BR>
beatroot [ -P <em>parameterFile</em> ] [ --<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em> ... ] -g<BR>
beatroot [ -P <em>parameterFile</em> ] [ --<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em> ... ] -a <em>audioFile</em><BR>
beatroot [ -P <em>parameterFile</em> ] [ --<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em> ... ] -m <em>midiFile</em><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
BeatRoot may be run in GUI (graphical user interface) or batch mode.
The graphical mode is the default if no options are given.
If any parameters or options are specified on the command line, then the
default is to run in batch mode.
Graphical mode is selected explicitly with the
<FONT face=courier>-g</FONT> switch.
<P>
In graphical mode, the input file names are entered using
the GUI. Parameter settings can be entered via the command
line, the GUI or a file of parameter settings.
Parameter settings are read from the file
<FONT face=courier>~/.beatrootrc</FONT> (if it exists),
then from any file specified using the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> switch, then from any command line parameters,
and finally any parameters entered in the GUI Options field.
Full details of parameter settings are given below.
<P>
In batch mode, all input file names are specified on the command line.
Parameter settings are read from the file
<FONT face=courier>~/.beatrootrc</FONT> (if it exists),
then from any file specified using the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> switch and then from any command line parameters.
Audio input files are specified with the <FONT face=courier>-a</FONT> switch,
and MIDI input files with the <FONT face=courier>-m</FONT> switch.

<H3>File formats</H3>
Audio files may be in WAV or SND (i.e. SUN's .snd format, not Macintosh's)
format.
All files are assumed to be 1 or 2 channel, 16-bit linear PCM coded,
at any sampling rate. If you have data in other formats, a utility like
<FONT face=courier><B>sox</B></FONT> can be used to convert it to one of
the standard formats accepted by BeatRoot.
<P>
MIDI files may be any standard midi file (type 0 or type 1), or the text
MIDI format produced by the <FONT face=courier><B>mf2t</B></FONT> program.
BeatRoot also accepts the Match file format, which you have probably never
heard of if you don't work at OeFAI.
<P>
BeatRoot recognises the following filename extensions: .wav, .snd, .mid, .tmf,
.match; if a file has any other extension (or the wrong one), its format
should be set explicitly using the <B>format</B> parameter (see below).

<H2>BeatRoot Graphical User Interface</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
You might want to start by reading the
<a href="http://www.oefai.at/~simon/pub/icmc2001.ps.gz">ICMC paper</a>
to get an overview of the system.
Click on <B>New</B> to open an audio or MIDI file.
The system performs beat tracking automatically and marks the beats
on the visual display with red vertical lines.
Click on <B>Play</B> to listen to the results.
Errors can be corrected using the mouse: the left button moves beats,
the middle button adds new beats and the right button deletes beats.
<P>
Note that large audio
files will take a few seconds to load. It is not recommended to use files
that are larger than about 40% of the amount of RAM your system has.
For example, a 5 minute stereo WAV file with 44.1kHz sampling rate is
about 50MB, which is about the limit if you have 128MB RAM.

<H3>Detailed description of GUI components and controls</H3>
The graphical user interface consists of two main components, the data display
(at the top) and the control panel (at the bottom).<BR>
The data display consists of the following components:
<UL>
<LI>Scrollbar: directly below the data display is a scrollbar, used to view
different parts of a piece.
<LI>Time line: at the bottom of the data display is a time axis, showing
the time in seconds from the beginning of the input data.
<LI>Onset times: short blue vertical lines mark the onset times of notes
in MIDI (i.e. note-on messages) or audio (as detected by the onset detection
algorithm, which is a simple time-domain algorithm, not designed to accurately
find all onsets).
<LI>Amplitude envelope (audio input only): the amplitude envelope is shown
in green, calculated from an RMS average of a 20ms window of audio data,
with 50% overlap between successive windows (default parameter settings).
<LI>Spectrogram (audio input only; not used by default): it is possible
to show a spectrogram of the audio data in addition to the amplitude
envelope and onset times, but this is really slow and has been disabled
by default.
<LI>Piano roll notation (MIDI input only): the pitches and durations of notes
are shown as blue horizontal lines in standard piano roll notation.
<LI>Beat times: red vertical lines mark the times of beats, as computed
by BeatRoot or entered by the user.
<LI>Inter-beat intervals: the times between pairs of beats are shown
(in milliseconds) at the top of the data display. The resolution is around
5ms when the view range contains 5 seconds of data. (Note that audio onset
detection uses a resolution of 10ms by default.)
</UL>
The mouse is used to edit the beat times on the data display as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Use the left mouse button to move beats by clicking on a beat line and
dragging it to the desired location.
<LI>Use the middle mouse button to add a new beat at the cursor location.
<LI>Use the right mouse button to delete a beat at the cursor location.
<LI>By clicking with the left mouse button on the time axis,
you can select a region of the music. A single click will select from
the current point to the end of the file. The selected region is highlighted
in grey in the area above the time line. A region bounded at both ends
can be selected by clicking at one end and dragging to the other end.
The selected region can be
cleared by clicking the right mouse button on the time axis.
</UL>
The control panel consists of the following components:
<UL>
<LI><B>File name:</B> the name of the currently loaded data file. This field is
not editable.  (To change files use the <B>New</B> button.)
<LI><B>Options:</B> any number of options may be specified in the format<BR>
<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em><BR>
with the only spaces being between the value and the next parameter
(if there is one).
For a list of parameters, see the batch mode section below.
<LI><B>View Range:</B> this is the number of seconds of data
that are visible on the screen.
This can be increased or decreased with the <B>+</B> and <B>-</B>
buttons respectively, or a value can be entered in the text field between the
two buttons.
<LI><B>New</B> button: load a new data file (audio or midi).
A window will appear which allows you to select the data file.
This will clear any currently loaded data. When the file is loaded, beat
tracking will be performed automatically. For large data files, you will
have to wait a few seconds while the data is processed.
<LI><B>Load beats</B> button: load a file of beat times (assumed to be one
you previously saved using BeatRoot).
<LI><B>Clear</B> button: delete all of the beats. If a region is selected,
only the beats in that region will be deleted.
<LI><B>Re-track</B> button: performs beat tracking on the whole file (no
region selected) or from the selected region to the end of the file. 
If a region is selected, the tempo and phase of beats before the region will
be used as the basis for further beats. Note that there is no way to retrack
only the middle of a file. Therefore if you plan to use this button,
all manual changes should be made in chronological order,
that is from the beginning to the end of the file.
<LI><B>Undo</B> button: undoes one operation (only), restoring the previous
list of beats after a clear, re-track or load beats command.
<LI><B>Cut file</B> button: not for general use.
(It divides a midi file into several files, using the beat positions as
file boundaries.)
<LI><B>Save beats</B> button: saves the beat times
in text MIDI format, using the file name of the input file (without extension)
appended by "-beatTrackData.tmf".
<LI><B>Save beats as</B> button: saves the beats times in MIDI or text MIDI
format, allowing the user to specify the file name.
<LI><B>Save all</B> button: saves the input data and beat data together in
the same format as the input data (i.e. audio or MIDI). Note that the beat
times cannot be retrieved from such a file when the input data is audio.
<LI><B>Play</B> button: plays the input data with a percussion instrument
sounding at each beat time. Note that there will be a time delay before a
large audio file starts playing. Play requests are queued.
<LI><B>Stop</B> button: stop the playback. If you have pressed <B>Play</B>
more than once, the next file will start playing automatically.
<LI><B>Quit</B> button: end the program.
</UL>
<H3>Bugs</H3>
There are no known bugs (or else I would have fixed them!).
Please mail bug reports to 
<a href="mailto:simon@oefai.at">simon@oefai.at</a>.<BR>
Sometimes the system stops responding. As far as I can tell, this is
a bug in the Java runtime environment. It is generally accompanied by
a Java Exception message on the shell window where the program was launched.
Let me know if you work out how to cause (or fix) this problem.

<H2>BeatRoot Parameter Settings</H2>

BeatRoot uses default values for all parameters, chosen to give reasonable
performance across a range of data. For specific data sets, alternative
parameter settings can be specified on the command line, the options field of
the graphical user interface, or in a parameter file.
On startup, the system reads the file
<FONT face=courier>~/.beatrootrc</FONT>,
then any parameter file specified with the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> option,
then the command line parameters (assuming they come after the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> option),
and finally any settings in the options field of the GUI.
If a parameter is set more than once, the later setting overrides the earlier
value.
Parameter settings are always of the form:<BR>
<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em><BR>
with no spaces. In files, each parameter setting is on a line by itself;
in the text box, successive settings are separated by spaces, and on the 
command line, the parameter settings are preceded by -- (two minus signs)
and separated by spaces. Warning: parameter names are case sensitive.
<P>
Input parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>start</B> (type: double; default value: 0)<BR>
Start time in seconds relative to the beginning of the file.
<LI><B>length</B> (type: double; default value: -1)<BR>
Length of input data to be loaded, in seconds. -1 indicates `to end of file'.
<LI><B>format</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Not necessary if the input file has the expected extension (see above).
Otherwise this parameter should specify one of the following formats:
wav, snd, mid, tmf, match.
<LI><B>channels</B> (type: string; default value: add)<BR>
What to do with a 2-channel input file. The choices are:
add (create a 1-channel file containing the sum of the 2 channels),
subtract (create a 1-channel file containing the difference of the 2 channels),
both (keep both channels unchanged),
left (create a 1-channel file consisting of only the left channel of the input)
and right
(create a 1-channel file consisting of only the right channel of the input).
</UL>
<P>
Output parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>play</B> (type: string; default value: on)<BR>
Used in batch mode to select whether audio output should be sent to the
sound card. Choices: on, off.
<LI><B>audioOut</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Used in batch mode to select a file name for saving audio output.
By default, audio output is played but not saved.
<LI><B>stereo</B> (type: string; default value: on)<BR>
Selects the output format of audio data. Choices: on (input data and beats
appear on separate channels; incompatible with channels=both), off (input data
is mixed with beats on the same channel(s)).
<LI><B>metronome</B> (type: string; default value: <em>useless</em>)<BR>
This is used to select the click sound used to mark the beats in audio output.
This should be an audio file containing a single percussion stroke with onset
as close as possible to the beginning of the file.
A suitable file (33-metclick.wav) is provided with BeatRoot.
Set this parameter to the full path name of this file.
<LI><B>clickTrackOnly</B> (type: string; default value: <em>not used</em>)<BR>
File name for saving an audio track consisting of clicks at times of
detected onsets. Not particularly useful, except in demonstrations
(hearing the audio world from the system's point of view).
<LI><B>midiOut</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Used in batch mode to specify the file name for saving MIDI output
(i.e. input data + beats).
<LI><B>tmfDefaults</B> (type: string; default value: see below)<BR>
Parameter settings for MIDI output, in TMF format, placed at the beginning
of the MIDI output file.
By default, this is used so that MIDI channel 1 is panned left,
and MIDI channel 10 (the beat track) is panned right.
<LI><B>midiMetronome</B> (type: int; default value: 56)<BR>
This is used to select the click sound used to mark the beats in MIDI output.
It specifies the note number used in the MIDI output for beats.
The standard drum kit settings have many possible sounds, for example:
sticks (31), thud (32), metronome (33), metronome with bell (34), cowbell (56),
woodblock (76, 77), muted triangle (80) and open triangle (81).
</UL>
Beat induction parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>clusterWidth</B> (type: double; default value: 0.025)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; in seconds.
<LI><B>minCluster</B> (type: double; default value: 0.070)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; the smallest cluster interval, in seconds.
<LI><B>maxCluster</B> (type: double; default value: 2.500)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; the largest cluster interval, in seconds.
<LI><B>minIBI</B> (type: double; default value: 0.250)<BR>
The minimum inter-beat interval (maximum tempo), in seconds.
0.250 sec/beat = 240 BPM.
<LI><B>maxIBI</B> (type: double; default value: 0.750)<BR>
The maximum inter-beat interval (minimum tempo), in seconds.
0.750 sec/beat = 80 BPM.
<LI><B>hopSize</B> (type: double; default value: 0.010)<BR>
Time resolution for beat induction of audio, in seconds.
<LI><B>overlap</B> (type: int; default value: 2)<BR>
The number of hops in a frame: FrameSize = overlap * hopSize.
FrameSize is the window size for calculating the amplitude envelope of audio
data.
<LI><B>peakWidth</B> (type: int; default value: 5)<BR>
Minimum gap between onsets, expressed as a multiple of the hopSize:
Peak separation = peakWidth * hopSize.
<LI><B>thresholdFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 10.0)<BR>
Used to reject peaks in the slope of the amplitude envelope which have
an amplitude less than the average amplitude divided by thresholdFactor.
</UL>
Beat tracking parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>innerMargin</B> (type: double; default value: 0.040)<BR>
Used in beat tracking algorithm; in seconds. Should be less than
IBI * preMarginFactor and IBI * postMarginFactor.
<LI><B>preMarginFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 0.2)<BR>
Specifies, as a fraction of the IBI, how early (before its predicted time)
a beat can be.
<LI><B>postMarginFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 0.4)<BR>
Specifies, as a fraction of the IBI, how late (after its predicted time)
a beat can be.
<LI><B>correctionFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 50.0)<BR>
Controls how much an agent's tempo estimate is modified by beats off
the predicted beat time. The tempo hypothesis is adjusted by
(predictedTime - actualTime) / correctionFactor.
<LI><B>expiryTime</B> (type: double; default value: 5.0)<BR>
Specifies how long an agent survives (in seconds) when it finds no event
corresponding to its beat prediction. If you get the message
`Beat tracking failed', it is usually due to this value being too low.
For example, a 5 second silence in any piece of music will cause all agents
to give up, and beat tracking to fail, assuming the default expiryTime.
<LI><B>averageSalience</B> (type: string; default value: off)<BR>
Specifies whether the agents' evaluation function
is based on the sum (off) or average (on) of adjusted salience values.
</UL>
MIDI beat tracking parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>mergeWidth</B> (type: double; default value: 0.070)<BR>
Specifies the window size in seconds
within which notes are grouped as a single rhythmic event.

Specifies the type of salience calculation. Choices:
additive, multiplicative, constant.
<LI><B>durationWeight</B> (type: double; default value: 300.0)<BR>
Specifies the weight given to duration in the salience calculation.
<LI><B>pitchWeight</B> (type: double; default value: 4.0)<BR>
Specifies the weight given to pitch in the salience calculation.
<LI><B>salienceFilter</B> (type: double; default value: <em>not used</em>)<BR>
Specifies a salience threshold, below which rhythmic events are considered
non-salient.
<LI><B>normaliseSalience</B> (type: string; default value: off)<BR>
Specifies whether salience calculations should be normalised by a local average.
Choices: on, off.
</UL>
Software paths:
<UL>
<LI><B>classpath</B> (type: string; default value: <em>unknown</em>)<BR>
Specifies where the Java classes for the user interface are found.
This will be something like <B>/home/simon/beatroot-0.2/</B>
although your name is probably not simon :)
<LI><B>timidity</B> (type: string; default value: <em>unknown</em>)<BR>
Specifies where to find the software synthesis program Timidity, which
is required for MIDI playback.
This is available from Debian and RedHat, or from
<a href="http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/">
http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/</a>
<LI><B>m2t</B> (type: string; default value: m2t)<BR>
