Theories can then beformulated and verified using empirical data and models, which in turn can be updated to reflect new knowledge.  Thus, modeling the cognitive processes associated with rhythm and music in general, can yield betterunderstanding of the functions underlying specific behavioralresponses to music and rhythm.  This knowledge is potentially useful to composers, performers, designers of codec\footnote{The term codec stands for ``compression/decompression''. A codec is an algorithm, orspecialized computer program that does exactly that. Popular audiocodecs include MPEG 1 Layer 3 (mp3) and Sony minidisc.} algorithms, interactive music and media systems \cite{Desain:92}.These models embody functional relationships between physicalproperties of sound and resulting human behavior and sensations.Thus it is important to make distinctions between the physicalproperties of sound, called {\it phenomenal}, that can be measured and theirperceptual correlates.  %% looks good as is%\begin{center}%\begin{table}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} % all cell contents aligned center \hline  & \\ Physical properties of sound  & Perceptual correlates \\ \hline \hline & \\ Frequency & Pitch   \\ \hline & \\ Signal Intensity & Loudness   \\ \hline & \\ Differences in sounds with identical loudness and pitch & Timbre \\ \hline\end{tabular}\caption {Properties of sound and their perceptual correlates}\end{table}%\end{center}\vspace{7mm}\section{Time}\vspace{3mm}\subsection{Temporal Representations in Music}Music is time-based art form that always occurs in some culturalcontext. Accordingly, the representation of musical time is culturally dependent. Different cultures have time represented differently in their cognitive structures, for example, in some contexts, time is seen as a circular structure, rather than acontinuum \cite{Gardenfors:2000}. Musical enculturation is thus a combination of perception and the organisation of sounds based on internalised cultural templates \cite[p. 5]{Smith:99}. Different areasof research also have different perspectives and interests inrepresenting time. For example, while musicologists might beinterested in representations that facilitate notation and transcription,composers and performers might be more interested in representations that are designed to work in process-oriented real-time systems \cite{Honing:93}.There are several different views of temporal representation inmusic. These include {\it tacit}, {\it implicit} and {\it explicit}time. Tacit time frameworks do not represent temporal evolution; there is only an idea of ``now''. Implicit time structures employ no definitive time relations since time is represented as an absolute, e.g. notelists, while explicit time structures represent time as relations thatcan be compounded to form higher level notions of time. Otherquestions that come up in the time modeling process deal with absoluteversus relative time bases, discrete versus continuous representationsand point-based versus intervallic time primitives. Point-basedimplies that events are duration-less and occur serially whileintervallic refers to differences between events that form the basisfor meaningful relations (intervals that occur before, after, during) \cite{Honing:93}.\begin{table}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline % | is used for a vertical line& \\Low Level: Expression  & {\it Perceptually represented} as departures \\                       & from canonical proportional values; poorly \\                       & quantified, and experienced as expressive \\                        & rather than durational effects. \\                        &  \\                       & {\it In Performance}, represented as programmed\\                       & variations in the rate of the clock controlling\\                       & beat durations (see level 2), and as modifications\\                       & of the procedures specifying individual notes\\                       & \\ \hline                       & \\Middle Level: Rhythm   & {\it Perceptually represented} as collection \\and meter              & of grouped durational equalities and \\                       & inequalities organized around a metrical \\                       & framework (when the music has a meter) \\                       &  \\                       & {\it In Performance}, represented as a \\                       & collection of untimed procedures, organized \\                       & metrical markers which are directly timed by \\                       & a programmable clock. \\                       & \\ \hline                       &  \\High Level: Form       & {\it Perceptually represented} as a structure\\                       & of hierarchical relations, constructed by means\\                       & of memory processes and perception, and \\                       & distinguished from level 2 structures by \\                       & exceeding the length of the perceptual present \\                       &  \\                       & {\it In Performance}, represented as a hierarchical \\                       & memory structure that forms the highest levels\\                       & of a motor program \\                       & \\ \hline\end{tabular}\caption {A summary of structural levels in musical time based on  meter and their cognitive/perceptual properties \cite[p. 233]{Clarke:87}.}\end{table}\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Causal versus Non-Causal Analysis}A further point regarding time arises when an interpretive process mustexamine some data structured in time. Some theories propose digestingwhole chunks of data as a unit while others choose to processthe data sequentially in time or causally. Opponents of the formerprocess, claim that ``theories that behave symmetric with respect to time have to be wrong on that basis alone. ... [those] theories tend to model the perceiver more like a musicologist studying thescore, instead of a first time listener'' \cite{Desain:92}. On theother hand, proponents claim that the non-causality of such modelsembodies a certain amount of enculturated knowledge that is essential toany interpretation, citing that performers have spent time with theirmusic and have definite intentions before a show \cite[p. 55]{Smith:99}. Analytically, causal methods can be seen as a subset of the largernon-causal methods, even though the tools may not be related.In any case, because humans infer musical structure based onboth universal ``hard-wired'' low level processing of sensory data(bottom-up processing) {\it and} culture specific knowledge,expectations and predictions (top-down processing)\cite[p. 27]{Todd:94}, robust models of rhythm perception must account for both bottom-up and top-down processing and cross-cultural variances. This makes room for multiple interpretations in which both causal andnon-causal methods are useful.\begin{table}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline % | is used for a vertical line& \\0 to 2-5 msecs apart   & Beats are perceived as simultaneous, \\                       & indistinguishable (even with different \\                       & loudness, but same duration) as a single\\                       & event. \\                       & \\ \hline                       & \\2-5 to 40 msecs apart  & Beats are distinguishable, but no order \\                       & relation can be indicated. \\                       & \\ \hline                       &  \\30 to 50 msecs apart   & Beats above this can produce an order \\                       & relation. \\                       & \\ \hline\end{tabular}\caption {A table summarising Leigh Smith's review of P{\"o}ppel's taxonomy of elementary time experiences \cite[p. 14]{Smith:99} }\end{table}\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Specious Present and Auditory Stores}Another aspect of time deals with the interval in whichevents are processed -- the {\it specious} present. Later called the psychological, perceptual or subjective present, it is related to the duration within which one experiences a sequence of events assimultaneously present in consciousness \cite[p. 97]{Gabrielsson:89}\cite{Fraisse:63}.Parncutt defines this perceptual present as a ``continuous timeinterval comprising all real-time percepts and sensationssimultaneously available to attention, perception and cognitive processing'' \cite[p. 451]{Parncutt:94}\cite[p. 12]{Smith:99}.Enabling this present is {\it echoic} memory, a kind of auditorysensory memory possessing a high degree of structure and organization \cite[p. 451]{Parncutt:94}. Echoic memory which is acoustic should be differentiated from {\it iconic} memory which is visual. There have been many different estimates in the literature on the size of echoic memory and the ``integrating buffers'', most of them limiting the echoic memory to less than 500 msec and thesubjective present to 4 seconds, with experimental results ranging between 2 and 10 seconds \cite[p. 12-3]{Smith:99}\cite[p. 451]{Parncutt:94}. Parncutt stresses that because the``present is so highly adaptive, no fixed parameter values can beexpected to describe it adequately'' \cite[p. 451-2]{Parncutt:94}. Furthermore, the present also depends on the rate events occur and their complexity and structure \cite[p. 452]{Parncutt:94}.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Synchronisation}Synchronisation is another aspect of rhythm that emerges from a notion oftime. Mari Riess Jones in an article entitled ``Time, Our LostDimension: Toward a New Theory of Perception, Attention andMemory'' states that the ``human system in general and the perceptualsystem in particular depend upon the properties of endogenousrhythmic processes in the nervous system'' \cite{Jones:76}. Additionally, many studies have suggested the presence of internal clocks and havenoted the strong connection between physical actions and perception \cite[p. 17]{Smith:99}. In reaction to a sound stream, humans are ableto forecast and coordinate motor action to coincide with future eventsfrom the sound stream. Smith claims that regularity is less important to the act of synchronisation than the listener's expectations and ability topredict, since accelerating and decelerating rhythms can betimed \cite{Smith:99}. Jones suggests that parts of the synchronisation process arebased on temporal expectancy.  Thus relations between certain time differences (time deltas) will hold for subsequent ones. This allowsthe listener to extrapolate time trajectories that predict when eventswill occur \cite{Jones:76}. \vspace{7mm}\section{Definitions}\vspace{3mm}How should we define rhythm?  Smith reports a variety of responses from the literature\cite[p. 9-10]{Smith:99}. Eric Clarke used the term broadly to applyto ``regular, periodic features of the temporal structure of music andto aperiodic features'' \cite{Clarke:85structure}. Dowling states thatrhythm is a temporally extended pattern of durational and accentual relationships, while Parncutt claims that musical rhythm is anacoustic sequence evoking a sensation of pulse\cite[p. 451]{Parncutt:94}.  Scheirer cites Handel's claims that``the experience of rhythm involves movement, regularity, grouping,and yet accentuation and differentiation'' \cite{Scheirer:98tempo}.According to psychological studies done by Gabrielsson on human ``subjects'', rhythm like timbre is a multi-dimensional quality. From the empirical studies, Gabrielsson points out the existence of at least fifteen dimensions which ``lend themselves to grouping into three categories'' related to structural, motional and emotionalaspects of rhythm. Refer to Table 4.\begin{table}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline % | is used for a vertical line& \\Structural Aspects     & Meter, position and strength of accents, \\                       & type and prominence of basic pattern, number \\                       & of different kinds of subdivisions within \\                       & beats, uniformity versus variation and  \\                       & simplicity versus complexity \\                       & \\ \hline                       & \\Motional Aspects       & Tempo and overall rapidity, however motional \\                       & characters exist such as walking, dancing,  \\                       & jumping, rocking, swinging, graceful and driving \\                       & forward \\                       & \\ \hline                       &  \\Emotional Aspects      & Vitality versus dullness, excitement versus \\                       & calmness, rigidity versus flexibility and  \\                       & solemnity versus playfulness \\                       & \\ \hline\end{tabular}\caption {Gabrielsson's dimensional categories for rhythm \cite[p. 107]{Gabrielsson:89}}\end{table}There are problems in modeling the ``dimensions'' mentioned abovebecause the interpretive ambiguity of the dimensions and characters do not lend easily to symbolic or quantitative representation. \vspace{7mm}\section{Pulse}\vspace{3mm}Parncutt's definition of a musical rhythm is an acousticsequence evoking a sensation of pulse.  How should we define pulse?  If a car drives by loudly broadcasting music, in the several seconds withinwhich the music is in earshot, the pulse would be the subjectiveevaluation of the feel or impression of movement inferred from themusic. If that music happened to be tabla drumming, Olatunji, Faithless orSubotnick, each would leave a different but firm impression in the mindof the listener.  The percept of pulse is confined to the time interval called thesubjective present \cite[p. 451]{Parncutt:94}. While {\it rhythm}deals with grouping and time hierarchies and {\it tempo} involves the rate at which rhythmically significant events occur, pulse correspondsto a ``sense of equally spaced phenomenal impulses''\cite{Scheirer:98tempo}. For many kinds of music, the pulse is the``foot-tapping'' beat.Pulse has also gone by other names like {\it tactus}, defined by Lerdahl andJackendoff to describe the most salient hierarchical level at whichthe listener will tap their foot in accompaniment to a rhythm \cite[p. 31]{Smith:99}.Parncutt defines it as a trivial sense of expectancy. Once a pulse isestablished, subsequent events are ``expected'' with some timetrajectory. This is of course related to our discussion above ofsynchronisation, where motor actions move along time trajectoriesinferred from this expectation \cite[p. 453]{Parncutt:94}.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Pulse Outside A Metrical Context}In non-metric musics, the pulse may not necessarily correspond to anisochronous period.  Researchers agree that the idea of a basic pulsein such music is ``usually misplaced'' \cite[p. 190]{Magill:97}Magill reports that \begin{quote}``West African drum ensemble music takes a multilayered approach torhythm, with all the parts being related to a fundamental {\it timeline}, often played on a bell... Bell patterns can nearly always besubdivided into a number of regular pulses (usually 8, 12, or16). Time lines or bell patterns betray asymmetric constructionand sound syncopated to Western ears'' \cite[p. 190]{Magill:97}.\end{quote}For example, in the A{\it n}lo drumming style from southern Ghana, Pantaleoni points out that it is ``the bell that regulates the play, and not the steady pulse some player or observer might feel, because the bell can put each pattern into its proper places, while a simplepulse can only regulate the speed with which the pattern is played''\cite[p. 60]{Pantaleoni:72}. Magill states that in many West African drumming styles while some instruments reinforce an underlying fast pulse, others might highlight portions of a bell pattern while others providea complex overlay of rhythms and meters \cite[p. 190]{Magill:97}. Inany case, while regular pulses are quite common, the traditional cultural view is that they are of peripheral importance compared to the asymmetric time line. The definition of pulse needs to be revised to be a periodic structuring or synchronization framework, since in the kinds of music discussed above, asymmetric time lines and isochronous pulses are both constructs within which higher levels of rhythmic time are structured. \vspace{5mm}\subsubsection{ The Fastest Pulse }Attempts to understand non-metric music have also emerged in the form ofconcepts like the ``fastest pulse''. The fastest pulse is defined as the ``beat with the shortest duration in the music considered''\cite[p. 33]{Smith:99} Smith cites Koetting's warning that the fastestpulse does not seem to describe how African timing is perceived\cite[p. 33]{Smith:99}.  Pantaleoni comments \begin{quote} ``I havenot found it to be a concept familiar to those African drummer with whom I have worked, nor does it seem to be an easy concept for them touse once it has been explained. Perhaps it is simply difficult for a performer to think as an analyst, but in the absence of some kind of positive support from the musicians themselves it cannot be assumed that a convenient analytical tool corresponds to the basic pulse or principle of timing which actually functions in the playing of the music'' \cite[p. 58]{Pantaleoni:72}. \end{quote}While clearly limited from a compositional and improvisational point of view, the idea of the fastest pulse might still be useful inanalysis. As will be seen in the next chapter, analyses that determinethe fastest pulse, per extracted stream, are a useful interpretive tool.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Beat Induction}Beat induction is a synchronization process with a phenomenal pulse.  There have been many successful attempts to measure the pulse computationally in Western classical and popular music, using that information to drive a foot-tapping process.  Eric Scheirer used filterbanks and parallel comb filters to extractamplitude envelopes and infer the beat from arbitrarily complex musical signals \cite{Scheirer:98tempo}.  Povel and Essens introduced the idea of ``internal clocks'' which are selected based on a set of inter-onset interval inputs. Desain and Honing have several computational beat-tracking methods to their name. Given an onset stream, their models return the beat of the stream. Different from the previous methods, Desain and Honing use a causal process model which takes theonset inputs sequentially and updates an expectancy measure.  Thebeat is then inferred from regions of high expectancy. Large and Kolen'sbeat-tracking model is based on non-linear oscillators. From a streamof onsets, a ``gradient-descent method'' is employed to continuallyupdate the period and phase of an oscillator, which represents thepulse \cite{Large:94}\cite{Scheirer:98tempo}. Goto presented a system which ``combines both low-level ``bottom-up'' signal processing and high-level pattern matching and ``agent-based'' representation to beat-track and do simple rhythmic grouping for popular music''\cite{Scheirer:98tempo}\cite{Goto:98}. Leigh Smith has also explored amultiscale representation of musical rhythm. Onset streams or pulsetrains are first decomposed using a Morlet wavelet basis. The``foot-tapping'' pulse of a section of music is then extracted by correlating frequency modulation ridges extracted from the waveletdecomposition using stationary phase, modulus maxima, dilation scale derivatives and local phase congruency. Refer to \cite{Smith:99} for definitions and implementation details.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Tempo}Tempo is defined here as the rate at which rhythmically significantevents occur. In music with an isochronous pulse, tempo is the rate ofthe tactus. In much Western music and popular music, this is the ``foottapping'' rate. In non-metrical settings, there may not be any explicitoverall tempo. In this case, there may be multiple rhythmic layerseach with its own individual rate. Tempo is however best used in a metrical setting. Commercial software systems express tempo in terms of beats per minute (BPM), while numerous scores have subjective tempo indications like {\it Larghissimo} or {\it Prestissimo} or moreconcrete markings like quarter note equals sixty.Within the above framework how do variations in tempo affect theinterpretation of rhythmic structure?  Clarke reports that slow tempiaid the cognitive process of segmentation at structural boundarypoints while at higher tempi, music tends to be grouped into fewerunits. This is claimed to occur because of the limits of the subjectivepresent. In other words, at faster tempi, more elements are packed intothe subjective present; thus given fixed maximum neural processingrates, music is subdivided into larger groups in accordance with its structural properties \cite[p. 36]{Smith:99}.\vspace{7mm}\section{Grouping}\vspace{3mm}Experiencing rhythm occurs as a whole sequence or pattern, not asindividual events. Within the subjective present, how a sequence is formed by segregating a stream of events is called grouping. Thiscan take the form of phrases or motives. In many cases, the number of events grouped together depends on the presentationrate, so the faster the rate, the more members are included in thegroup. This extends up to perceptual limits.  Some rhythmic groups are presented so quickly that they're not perceived asindividual rhythms or events but are lumped together to form a pitch percept. Within a sequence of events, certain ones with objective accents or differences suggest or confirm the presence of a perceptual groupboundary.  Quantities responsible for the percept of a group boundary include perceptual limits on memory and attention and cognitive representations.Smith points out two principal grouping principles: The {\it run} principle and the {\it gap} principle.  The run principle proposes that the longest run of similar events will begin a rhythmic pattern. Listeners tend to group sounds of the same intensity together. Runs of different intensity will be organized so that the longest runs areplaced at the beginning or end of the pattern, never in the middle. The gap principle refers to boundaries that are formed between dissimilar elements. Rests partition elements while elements close in time tend to be grouped \cite[p. 28]{Smith:99}. These principlesare based on Gestalt principles of perceptual organization andBregman's seminal work on auditory scene analysis\cite{Bregman:90}. Additionally, higher level grouping structures are bounded by repetitions. A single change in an established pattern can affect the entire grouping percept \cite[p. 28]{Smith:99}.Parncutt defines two independent kinds of temporal grouping, {\it serial} and {\it periodic}. Serial grouping (related to the gapprinciple) is dependent on the serial proximity of adjacent events intime, pitch and timbre. ``According to Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), serial grouping in music includes ``motives, themes, phrases, periods,theme-groups, sections, and the piece itself'' \cite{Lerdahl:83}. Periodic grouping on other hand, depends on the relative times and perceptual properties of {\it nonadjacent} events \cite[p. 412]{Parncutt:94}.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Meter}Meter can be seen as a form of periodic grouping. Parncutt states that itgroups events into equivalence classes, such as all {\it n}th beats ofa bar \cite[p. 412]{Parncutt:94}. He further classifies periodicgrouping as being an aggregate of two stages, {\it pulse sensation} and{\it perceived meter}. Interestingly enough, Halsband converselystates that grouping ``plays a major role in the perception of all metricallyorganized music'' \cite[p. 266]{Halsband:94}.  While grouping is a psychological term, meter is a product of musictheory and associated forms of notation. Repetition in meter, as in other groupings, plays an integral role in the determination of a metrical percept. However, the perceived meter in a performance may not necessarily correspond to the notated meter. In many of these cases, some initial metrical orientation influences the interpretationof subsequent sequences.  There are rarely explicit rules to outline an interpretation; in improvisational styles, performances ``unbounded by a strictmetric frame are not free in the sense of being unrhythmic. Rather, they are driven by rhythmic goals that are elastic'' \cite[p. 158]{Berliner:94}.Handel showed empirically that difficult rhythms with atypicalmetrical accenting were perceived in terms of elemental groupingschemes, rather than as a meter with a timing interval \cite[p. 31]{Smith:99}.Thus, a metrical percept is a regular alternation of strong and weakbeats. What then qualifies an event as particularly strong or weak?\begin{table}\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline % | is used for a vertical line& \\Well-Formedness Rule 1 & Every attack point must be associated with \\                       & a beat at the smallest level metrical level \\                       & present at that point in the piece. \\                       & \\ \hline                       & \\Well-Formedness Rule 2 & Every beat at a given level must also be a \\                       & beat at all smaller levels present at that \\                       & point in the piece. \\                       & \\ \hline                       & \\Well-Formedness Rule 3 & At each metrical level, strong beats are \\                        & spaced either two or three beats apart. \\                       & \\ \hline                       &  \\Well-Formedness Rule 4 & The tactus and immediately larger metrical \\                       & levels must consist of beats equally spaced \\                       & throughout the piece.

Smith cites Lerhdahl andJackendoff as distinguishing three kinds of accents, {\it phenomenal},{\it metrical} and {\it structural} according to their effect on groups \cite[p. 19]{Smith:99}. Phenomenal accents are saidto exist superficially, stressing a single moment and enablingsyncopations. Metrical accents occur when the emphasised beat ispart of a repeating metrical pattern. Structural accents occur atpoints hierarchically higher than meter. For example, structural accents could delimit phrases or sections.  Furthermore, a ``phenomenal accentfunctions as a perceptual input to metrical accent'' \cite{Lerdahl:83}.Accents occur when there are changes in duration, inter-onset interval (IOI), pitch, articulation, timbre or combinations thereof. Similarly changes in phrase length, time expectancies, event density (flams, fills, etc) or multiple event synchronisation can causeaccentuation \cite[p. 19]{Smith:99} \cite[p. 426]{Parncutt:94}. Articulation is one way to signify an accent. Berliner remarks that inthe jazz idiom, ghosting ``on-beat pitches in an eight-note sequencecreates de facto accents on every off-beat, increasing rhythmictension. Reversing the procedure relieves rhythmictension... Similarly the varied application of hard, soft and ghostedattacks can shift accents within a repeated eight-note triplet, changingits perceived rhythmic configuration and its relative syncopatedquality'' \cite[p. 156]{Berliner:94}.\begin{figure}[thp]  \begin{center}    \resizebox{5in}{!}{\includegraphics{AllThatJazz.pdf}}    \caption{``For a swinging performance the first of each pair of      eight notes is played longer than the second. The melody line      also hangs behind the cymbal beat, except for the occasional      off-beat synchronisation, which keeps the band together'' \cite{Hamer:2000}}    \label{allthatJazz}  \end{center}\end{figure}Accentuation is not always applicable to specifying grouping structureand its use varies with the musical context. For instance, using the A{\it n}lo dance drumming example, Pantaleoni reports that ``variationin loudness (phenomenal accents) is indeed an important part of the character of a rhythmic line in Atsi{\~ a}, but no evidence indicates that its contribution is more than melodic... Dynamic stress wouldseem to be individual, decorative, incidental, and often illusory, hardly a likely clue to rhythmic organisation'' \cite[pp. 54]{Pantaleoni:72}.\vspace{7mm}\section{Expressive Timing}\vspace{3mm}Many authors have explored what is known in rhythmic performances asexpressive timing. Discrepancies can always be found in the timingdictated by a score and that which occurs in a performance. Barringmistakes, which really are not plausible with highly trained musiciansfamiliar with the music, these deviations are ``related to thestructural properties of the music and to the ways the performersorganize'' these properties \cite{Clarke:85structure}. In an analysis of Erik Satie's ``Gnossienne No. 5'', Clarke reports that \begin{quote} ``the tempo marking is followed by the instruction ``souple etexpressif''. This is relevant to subsequent analysis, since itsuggests that the performance of the piece should avoid metronomictendencies in the left hand, and may encourage a rhythmic flexibilityin the right hand that conventional notation cannot convey'' \cite[p. 300]{Clarke:85}.\end{quote}Research has thus focused on determining exactly what deviations from the score contribute to a subjective feeling of expression that is not ``metronomic''. First some definitions: expressive timing refers to deviations in notated times that suggest particular structural interpretations or give the temporal development of the music a particular feel or sense of movement. Smith cites certain kindsof expressive timing as having evolved from a performance practice known as {\it rubato}, literally ``robbed time''\cite[pp. 37]{Smith:99}. In computer music, terms like ``micro-tempo''are used to describe this expressive phenomenon of local tempochanging from event to event. In all cases,these expressive timing transformations are used by performers either in response to structural features in the score or in attempt toexplore new interpretive configurations  or impose a particularstructure on structurally indeterminate material \cite{Clarke:85structure}.\begin{figure}[thp]  \begin{center}    \resizebox{4.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{OnBeat.pdf}}    \caption{``Imagining the beat as an ``elliptical figure'', the      drummer or bass player can play either ``ahead of the beat''      (that is, on the front part of the elliptical figure), ``behind      the beat'', (that is on the very end of the elliptical figure or      in varying degrees toward the center of the figure or ``on the      beat'' (that is, the center of the figure)'' \cite[p. 151]{Berliner:94}.}    \label{on the beat}  \end{center}\end{figure}In the jazz tradition, Berliner says that musicians ``talk about playing on three different parts of the beat without making anydifference in the overall tempo''. On a similar note, Fred Herschclaims that \begin{quote} ``there should be ten, fifteen different  kinds of time. There's a kind of time that has an edge on it for a  while and lays back for a while. Sometimes it rolls over the bar,  and sometimes it sits more on the beats.  That's what makes it  interesting. You can set a metronome here and by playing with an  edge or playing behind it or right in the center you can get all  kinds of different feelings. That's what makes it come alive. People  are human, and rhythmic energy has an ebb and flow'' \cite[p. 151]{Berliner:94}. \end{quote}\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Tempo Curves}Tempo curves are one way that timing deviations are represented incontemporary music software applications for notated music, offering a measure of ``beat-by-beat time deviation from a canonical metrical grid'' \cite[p. 39]{Smith:99}.This quasi-instantaneous tempo or {\it Local tempo} is definedcomputationally as the event to event ratio of score time intervalto performance time interval. $$ Local\ tempo = Global \ tempo \times {Score \ time \ interval  \over Performance \ time \ interval}$$ Tempo curves are thus constructed by connecting points with straight line segments between localtempo measures of each performed note in the score \cite{Smith:99}\cite{Desain:91}.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Expression and Structure}Desain and Honing warn that while they are useful to study expressivetiming, tempo curves can be is a ``dangerous notion''. This is becauseit encourages ``its users into the false impression that it has a musical andpsychological reality. There is no abstract tempo curve in the musicnor is there a mental tempo curve in the head of the performer orlistener'' \cite{Desain:91}. This is because tempo curves by themselvescontain no structural information. Thus global transformations, like scaling the overall tempo curve, will change timing relationships between notes that are ornamental and {\it invariant} with tempo. Furthermore, attempts to impose a tempo curve from the performance of one piece onto the score of another shows that tempo curves convey an erroneous notion that time is independent of the note events that mark it.This clearly ignores the fact that the expression captured by thetempo curve can only function with respect to the originalmusic performance from which it was derived \cite{Smith:99}\cite{Desain:91}\cite{Desain:91towards}. For a more in-depth discussion on expressive temporal transformations,refer to Desain and Honing's paper called ``Towards a Calculus for Expressive Timing in Music'' \cite{Desain:91towards}. \vspace{7mm}\section{A West African Concept of Rhythmic Time}\vspace{3mm}\subsection{Misunderstandings...}The relative lack of serious research on rhythm in sub-saharan African music is frankly baffling, given traditions so rich in rhythmic textures and structures. The {\sl Journal de la Discotheque Internationale de Musique Africaine} and the rare article in {\slMusic Perception} are the only academic journals where such music is even discussed. On the one hand, this paucity of work is understandable as most of the research in cognitive sciences is being done in Western universities with funding from local or national organizations; this is compounded by the fact that even the relatively simple rhythmic structure of most occidental music is still largely poorly understood.  What isparticularly grievous on the other hand is that the choice of musicchosen for experiments mirrors the aesthetic imperialism present in the global music industry. Furthermore, within Africa, the majority of research on rhythmcuriously involves Ghanian dance drumming. This in itself is peculiar,as the Ghanian styles are hardly representative of West African music. In many respects, any one of the plethora of cultures can hardly represent the varied use of rhythms. Again, I suspect that the popularity of such studies is strongly linked to the patronizationof Ghanian music schools by the Western academic elite and well-knowncomposers like Steve Reich, as well as a much stronger push byGhanians to export their culture.\vspace{5mm}\subsection{Asymmetric Cognitive Clocks}One useful research effort that appeared in a recent issue of {\sl Music Perception} investigated mental models used by expert African drummers in the production of polyrhythmic patterns. The paper fits into the category of work which pursues computational validation of ``culturally initiated beliefs'' about cognitive models. (That cultural aspects of a music and its production would not even be considered in a computational model is bewildering.)Experiments were conducted by recording the performance of a master Asante drummer's spontaneous patterns and responses to acomputer generated tone. Quantities such as pulse hand allocation(left or right), pulse stream size (three or four) were varied and measured \cite[p. 191]{Magill:97}.  The goal was to determine if the African cultural description of the cognitive process involved in producing rhythm is valid by computationally modeling the process and experimentally verifying its validity. The performance data was alsorun through a pulse-ground(PG) model based on the notion of meter as a means to check the data against another well understood model \cite[p. 191]{Magill:97}.The model used in the experiments is an asymmetric time-line-ground(TLG) model that represents a computational elaboration of the multilayeredtraditional West African understanding that all instruments in a percussion ensemble play in relation to a fundamental {\it time-line}.The asymmetry of the time-line Magill claims doesn't ``reduce to one ofadditive meter'' \cite[p. 191]{Magill:97} because much West Africanmusic is founded on the presence of parallel isochronous pulse streamsthat regularly cut across the additive subgroups. This is possiblebecause the cycle lengths of the asymmetric time-line are composite numbers (6, 8, 12, 24).  Furthermore, TLG model ``allows for thepresence of unequal clock pulses but assumes that where clockintervals are of the same duration, the variance of those two clockpulses will be equal'' \cite[p. 191]{Magill:97}.In performances by the master Asante drummer, Magill reports that the TLG provides a ``convincing'' fit to seven of the eight tests.The eighth required some modifications to the basic model. Magill comments further that the ``asymmetric process'' need not bebased on the single fastest pulse (additive meter) even though theexperimental results can be viewed in this light.
