Frequently while listening, I am deluged with musical ideas for a new work or work already in progress.  Many times, I find it difficult to pick out the individual patterns or understand, in real time, how different components of a percussion mix interrelate.  For the experienced listener and musician this might be a routine task, but I would argue that such transparency is less common in electronic or dance styles that play with the human perceptual limits (Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, etc) especially where the recording is the only source of information about the underlying musical and rhythmic structure. On one hand, repeated listenings and intensive study would facilitate a better understanding; however, for the compositional novice, a tool that embodied the skills of ear-training and expert knowledge on rhythm perception that could uncover the hidden structure and more complex inter-relationships between various elements of a mix, would be invaluable. Another compositional use of such a tool would be to aid mapping out new rhythmic configurations in a more orderly fashion.  Rather than employing music theoretic heuristics with ad-hoc trial and error experiments, new patterns could be systematically found by traversing {\it Rhythmic Spaces}, (defined below). The problem with trial and error is that it is time consuming. Managing the complexity of theinterrelationships between patterns and where they reside in the rhythmic space becomes unwieldy as the said patterns accumulate. With a computational tool, such an effort would be markedly simpler especially if rhythmic features are modeled parametrically. Several features that might be interesting to explore are onset timing intervals, accentuation of onsets, overall tempo and timing and grouping hierarchies between elements of a mix. A ``rhythmic space traversal'' would take a rhythmic pattern with certain of the above features and hold all but one constant while creating new patterns that varied the last feature in some way.\begin{figure}[thp]  \begin{center}    \resizebox{3.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{realtimeRiddim.pdf}}    \caption{Live performance with Riddim}    \label{A real-time possibility of Riddim}   \end{center}\end{figure}\vspace{7mm}\section{Towards a General Perceptual, Transcriptive Computational Tool}\vspace{3mm}A perceptual {\sl and} transcriptive tool is most useful to meet the compositional objectives described above.  It needs to betranscriptive because resynthesis can only take place from an abstractrepresentation. It also needs to be perceptual because no score oradvanced knowledge about the structure of the music may be available.In this case, any structure the listener perceives is inferredvia direct perception.  This is especially true of many styles,especially ones practiced solely in oral traditions. Is everything that is needed for a perceptual transcriptiverepresentation of rhythm present in the recorded audio?  Theinformation {\sl must} be contained in the structure of the audiowaveform because it is this same audio that is processed and understood by the brain. In the past, researchers have tended to focus on a very specific area of rhythm, be that tempo, beat-induction, metrical interpretation or rhythmic pattern recognition. Only rarely did they ever integrate their work in a framework concerned with the greater experience of rhythm perception.  What is attempted here is the development of a tool that explores a more integrative approach. Integrative is used in the sense that the streams of timing sequences extracted from an audio file can be incorporated in existing interpretive models of rhythm, that together can approach a computational correlate of a ``rhythmic percept''.\vspace{7mm}\section{Thesis Structure}\vspace{3mm}This thesis is structured in the following way. First, I will review themost salient literature on rhythm, by going through its various dimensions, discussing the history and varying opinions. Next I shall discuss my approach to developing {\it Riddim}, a rhythm analysis tool designed to attempt to meet some of the compositional needs described above.  This will include some high level algorithmic descriptions of my approach, a brief description of the development platform and how the various components operate.  Next, I will explain the workings of each of the algorithms and illustrate why they are important and how they are used, providing detailed diagrams of how data flows through each module.Finally, I shall show my results which are in-depth rhythmic analyses of a variety of musical recordings using {\it Riddim}. {\it Riddim} willbe distributed as a stand alone software application from which commands toperform a variety of rhythmic analyses can be executed. Results can thenbe viewed and saved as MIDI files or rendered as digital audio for usein subsequent creative settings.
