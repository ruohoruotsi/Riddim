I would like to thank Roger Dannenberg for introducing me to this
field and writing me a recommendation for Dartmouth. Arigato gozaimasu
to my teachers Jon Appleton, Eric Lyon, Charles Dodge 
and Larry Polanksy for providing the opportunity to attend Dartmouth 
and the nurturing environment to develop and produce this work.  

Ridiculous amounts of thanks to Hany Farid for signing on to be an
advisor and tolerating random emails for help throughout the year.

Major muchas gracias to Ray Guillette for moral support, advice and 
assistance with the design of {\it Riddim}'s Graphical User
Interface. Cheers to Michael Casey for providing MATLAB demos, 
suggestions and feedback that ultimately enabled this work. Thanks to 
John Puterbaugh for technical advice and book suggestions 
like ``Conceptual Spaces''.

Vielen Dank to Barbara Tillmann and D{\^ e}kuji to Petr Janata for 
reviewing the final document on such short notice and giving many 
useful comments.

Tusen takk to the nordic nightmare for offering suggestions, papers to
read and numerous insights on rhythm. Mahalo nui loa to Moki for 
reviewing the kosherness of my diagrams and generally adding
value. And grazie mille to Dee for making the world a safer place 
for everybody!!
