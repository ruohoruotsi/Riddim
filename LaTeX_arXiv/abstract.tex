The goal of this thesis was to implement a tool that, givena digital audio input, can extract and represent rhythm and musical time. The purpose of the tool is to help develop better models of rhythm for real-time computer based performance and composition. This analysis tool, {\sl Riddim}, uses Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) and a robust onset detection scheme to separate and detect salient rhythmic and timing information from different sonic sources within the input. This information is then represented in a format that can be used by a variety of algorithms that interpret timing information to infer rhythmic and musical structure. A secondary objective of this work is a ``proof of concept'' as anon-real-time rhythm analysis system based on ISA.  This is a necessary step since ultimately it is desirable to incorporate this functionality in areal-time plug-in for live performance and improvisation.
